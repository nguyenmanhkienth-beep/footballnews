<p> 1. <b> Uzbekistan </b> </p>

<p> The golden era of Uzbekistan football has written a new glore for this nation. They won 6 games and lost only 2022 edition's host Qatar 2-3 in last year November. Two dramatic draws against group's winner Iran, and the decisive win against team's direct rival gave them 6-point lead and successfully stand at second position. </p>

<p> 2. <b> Jordan </b> </p>

<p> One point shied the Iraq from World Cup, but it also created a wonderful ending for "Magic Jordan". Dating back to 4 years ago when Jordan even lost to Vietnam in Asian Cup, they now have been contient's runner-up and further World Cup participant. Trio Yazan Al-Naimat, Ali Olwan and Musa Al-Taamari dominated car defenses with combined 19 goals over three rounds.</p>

<p>3.<b> Estevao vs Senegal </b> </p> 
<p> Brazil's breakthrough came in the 28th minute when Casemiro’s intended through-ball deflected off a Senegalese defender, falling perfectly into the path of Estevao, who arrived at lightning speed to clinically slot a left-footed shot inside the far post.
The lead was doubled in the 35th minute via a set-piece masterclass. Rodrygo delivered a pinpoint free kick to an unmarked Casemiro at the far post. The veteran midfielder controlled the ball expertly before curling home from close range, leaving keeper Edouard Mendy helpless.
Senegal came close to pulling one back before halftime, with Ederson called upon to make crucial saves from Pape Gueye and Ismaila Sarr during added time.
The second half saw Senegal squander a golden opportunity to get back in the match. In the 51st minute, Ederson's misstep while handling the ball gifted Iliman Ndiaye an open goal; however, the forward inexplicably struck the post from point-blank range. </p>

<p>4. <b> Estevao vs Tunisia </b> </p> 
<p> The Chelsea winger scored a penalty in the first half for Brazil in a 1-1 draw against Tunisia in an international friendly last night.

He also hit the post right at the end of the game, coming very close to winning it for Brazil.

But that goal marked his 5th senior goal for Brazil, and he’s now only second to Pele in reaching that milestone.

As relayed by Chelsea Stats, Estevão [18 years and 7 months] is the 2nd youngest player to reach the milestone of 5 goals for the Brazilian national team! Only Pelé did it at younger age (17 years and 7 months) in 1958. </p>
